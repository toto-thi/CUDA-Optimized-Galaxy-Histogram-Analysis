This project leverages CUDA to accelerate histogram computation for galaxy data analysis on NVIDIA GPUs. It processes large datasets of galactic coordinates to calculate histograms that represent spatial distributions of real and simulated galaxies. The program minimizes global memory access by utilizing shared memory within each CUDA block, optimizing runtime. Benchmarks show substantial speedups, with execution times of 2 seconds on a high-CPU configuration (98% utilization) and 0.78 seconds on an NVIDIA Tesla V100. This approach supports rapid, accurate galaxy data processing, which is ideal for high-performance environments.
